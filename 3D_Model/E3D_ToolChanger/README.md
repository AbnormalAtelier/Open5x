# E3D ToolChanger Open5x Implementation

This is a work-in-progress folder for files associated with creating an Open5X ToolChanger. The files are provided, as-is, with no implied further support. Fabricating the module is easy but there is inherent risk with its use; collisions or other issues could cause permanent mechanical damage. Use at your own risk.

The files included in this folder have been tested on an E3D Beta30 ToolChanger and may require modification for production systems.
