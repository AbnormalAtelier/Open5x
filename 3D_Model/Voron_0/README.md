# Voron 0 Open5x Implementation

This is a work-in-progress folder for files associated with creating an Open5X Voron 0. The files are provided, as-is, with no implied further support. Fabricating the module is easy but there is inherent risk with its use; collisions or other issues could cause permanent mechanical damage. Use at your own risk.

The files included in this folder have been tested on a Voron v0.1 and may require modification for other versions.
