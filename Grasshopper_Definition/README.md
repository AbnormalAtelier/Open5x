# Introduction

This folder contains the necessary files for using Grasshopper to create 5-axis G-code.
Grasshopper is a visual scripting extension that is integrated into a popular 3D CAD software called Rhino 3D.
Unfortunately, Rhino 3D is not a free software, but a 90 days fully functioning free-trial version is provided.

The grasshopper script here is still undergoing improvment and development.
The eventual goal is to migrate the system off Rhino 3D and operate somewhere free and opensource. 



The current iteration of the Grasshopper script require the below depdendencies:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq?view=net-6.0 : To collect max/min values in list
