To start using grasshopper first a Pursa 3D model need to be uploaded into the script.
To do this double click the component called 'Simulation' and inside right-click the component 'Prusa i3 Profile_PATH' and upload the file 'Prusa_5axis_profile_v2' 
Once complete this should show up in the simulation.
