To start using grasshopper first a Pursa 3D model need to be uploaded into the script.
To do this double click the component called 'Simulation' and inside right-click the component 'Prusa i3 Profile_PATH' and upload the file 'Prusa_5axis_profile_v2' 
Once complete this should show up in the simulation.

Please note that the current version is the developing version. and more stable versions are aimed to be relased very soon.
3 Different toolpath generator will be relased focusing at 1) Supportless 3D printing 2) Conformal Surface finish 3) Curve based conformal patterning
